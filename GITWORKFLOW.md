## Branching Strategy

We use a **hybrid trunk-based and release-based development** model with the following long-lived branches:

- **main**: Always production-ready. Only stable, tested code is merged here. All releases are tagged from this branch.
- **chatraj-v2**: Major version 2 development. Used for large architectural changes and next-gen features.
- **stable-build**: Mirrors the latest production deployment. Used for hotfixes and emergency patches.
- **chatraj-v1.1**: Maintenance branch for v1.1.x releases. Critical bugfixes and security patches only.

Short-lived branches are created for features, bugfixes, releases, and experiments:

- **feature/\***: New features (e.g., `feature/ai-assistant`, `feature/file-upload`)
- **bugfix/\***: Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/chat-scroll`, `bugfix/editor-overflow`)
- **release/\***: Release preparation (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`)
- **hotfix/\***: Urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/login-crash`)
- **experiment/\***: Prototypes and research (e.g., `experiment/webassembly-support`)

### 2. Feature Development Lifecycle

```mermaid

    Dev->>Repo: branch from chatraj-v2 (feature/ai-assistant)
    Dev->>Repo: push commits
    Dev->>Repo: open Pull Request to chatraj-v2
    Repo->>Dev: CI/CD runs, code review
    Dev->>Repo: address review comments
    Repo->>chatraj-v2: merge after approval
```

### 3. Release & Hotfix Flow

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clarity and automation.

- **Format:** `<type>(scope): short description`
- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`
- **Examples:**
  - `feat(chat): add emoji reactions`
  - `fix(editor): resolve code area overflow on mobile`
  - `docs(readme): update usage guide`
  - `refactor(socket): modularize event handlers`
  - `perf(file-tree): optimize rendering for large projects`

**Commit Body (optional):**
- Use for detailed explanations, links to issues, or migration notes.

**Footer (optional):**
- Reference issues, breaking changes, or co-authors.
  - `BREAKING CHANGE: file format updated`
  - `Closes #42`

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch from the correct base** (`chatraj-v2`, `main`, or `stable-build`).
2. **Push commits** to your feature/bugfix branch.
3. **Open a Pull Request** (PR) to the target branch.
4. **PR Requirements:**
   - Clear title and description.
   - Reference related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`).
   - Pass all CI checks (lint, build, tests).
   - Assign reviewers and request review.
   - Add screenshots or diagrams for UI/UX changes.
   - Update documentation and `CHANGELOG.md` if needed.
5. **No direct commits to `main`, `chatraj-v2`, or `stable-build`**â€”all changes go through PRs.

---

## Code Review Process

- At least **one approval** is required before merging.
- Reviewers check for:
  - Code correctness, maintainability, and style.
  - Test coverage and passing tests.
  - Security and privacy considerations.
  - Documentation and changelog updates.
- Use GitHub review tools for comments, suggestions, and approvals.
- Address all review comments before merging.
- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for architectural or controversial changes.

---

## Release Management

### Release Branches

- **Create `release/x.y.z`** from `chatraj-v2` (or `main` for patch releases).
- Finalize documentation, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and bump version.
- Run full regression and integration tests.
- Merge `release/x.y.z` into `main` and tag the release.
- Merge back into `chatraj-v2` and `stable-build` to keep branches in sync.
- Deploy from `main` to production.

### Release Checklist

- [ ] All features and bugfixes merged.
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E).
- [ ] Documentation and changelog updated.
- [ ] Version bumped in `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Release notes drafted and reviewed.
- [ ] Tag created and pushed.
- [ ] Production deployment verified.

---

## Hotfixes & Emergency Patches

- Branch `hotfix/issue-#` from `stable-build` or `main` for urgent production fixes.
- Apply the fix, test, and open a PR to `stable-build` and `main`.
- After merge, also merge `main` back into `chatraj-v2` and other active branches to propagate the fix.
- Tag the hotfix release.

---

## Tagging & Versioning

- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Tag releases on `main` (e.g., `v2.0.0`).
- Annotate tags with release notes and changelog links.
- Example:
  - `git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0: AI Assistant, Real-time Collaboration"`
  - `git push origin v2.0.0`

---

## Best Practices

- **Small, focused commits:** Each commit should address a single concern.
- **Descriptive branch names:** Use `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, or `release/` prefixes.
- **Keep branches up to date:** Regularly rebase or merge the base branch into your branch.
- **Write tests:** All new features and bugfixes must include relevant tests.
- **Update documentation:** Keep `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and other docs current.
- **Automated CI/CD:** All PRs must pass automated checks before merging.
- **Code ownership:** Assign code owners for critical modules.
- **Security:** Review dependencies and follow secure coding practices.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure UI changes meet accessibility standards.
- **Communication:** Use PR descriptions, comments, and diagrams to clarify changes.
