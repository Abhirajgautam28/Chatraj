## High-Level Flow

1. **User Authentication:** JWT-based, with user data stored in MongoDB.
2. **Project Management:** Users create/join projects, each with its own file tree and collaborators.
3. **Real-time Collaboration:** Socket.io enables live chat, typing indicators, and code editing.
4. **AI Assistance:** Users can invoke AI for code suggestions, file structure, and explanations.
5. **Frontend-Backend Communication:** REST APIs for CRUD, Socket.io for real-time, and AI endpoints for code generation.

## Deployment & Scalability

- **Frontend:** Deployable on Vercel/Netlify.
- **Backend:** Deployable on cloud VMs or services like Heroku, with environment-based config.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted.
- **Redis:** For caching and session management.
- **AI Keys:** Per-user Gemini API key support.

## Security & Privacy

- JWT authentication
- Role-based access for projects
- Local storage and auto-delete for chat history
- Environment variables for secrets

---

## Extensibility

- Modular codebase (routes, services, controllers)
- Easily add new AI providers or project categories
- Pluggable UI components
