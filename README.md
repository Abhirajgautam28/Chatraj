# ChatRaj
ChatRaj is an AI-powered backend for a software engineering collaboration platform. It provides secure project management, user authentication, real-time collaboration, and AI-assisted development features. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis, with integration for Google Generative AI to assist in software development tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js & Express:** Server-side API and middleware implementation.
- **MongoDB:** Document-oriented database to store project and user data.
- **Redis:** Caching, session management, and token blacklisting.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Google Generative AI:** For code generation, debugging, and development assistance.
- **Socket.io (if used):** Real-time collaboration features.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or above)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or hosted)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatRaj.git
   cd ChatRaj/Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   For security purposes, the .env file is not included in the repository. Create a new file named .env in the Backend folder with the following content (update the values as needed):
   ```properties
   PORT=8080
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ChatRaj
   JWT_SECRET=ChatRaj_Secret
   REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
   REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
   GOOGLE_AI_KEY=your_google_ai_key
   ```

4. **Starting the Server:**
   If you have defined a "dev" script in your package.json, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Otherwise, start the server using:
   ```bash
   npx nodemon
   ```

## Testing the Application
- Use Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints.
- Check the terminal output for log messages and error outputs during server operation.
